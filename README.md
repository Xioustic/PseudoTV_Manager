PyPTVMan
========
This is a fork of the channel managers built for PseudoTV and PseudoTVLive. 

The intention of this fork is to port the application to Python2 and PyQt4 from Visual Basic. in order to make the application usable cross-platform and decrease overhead for improving and fixing up the code.

Why?
====
- Python2 and PyQt4 run very well and easily on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac).
- A port using those technologies can be made to look nearly identical to the current application.
- Python and PyQt are arguably more accessible and easier to debug compared to Visual Basic.
- Python is THE programming language used by most Kodi/XBMC addon developers, which would include the host PseudoTV Live application.
